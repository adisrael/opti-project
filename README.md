Inter-school Sports Leagues Calendarization
====

#### Optimization project created for ICS1113 - Optimization class at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC).

The project describes a calendarization problem related to inter-school sports legaues.

In it we model a pseudo-real situation relating the situation around a school in Santiago, Chile.

You can see the math implementation of the model and some analysis (in Spanish) regarding the project in the .pdf file attached to this repo.

Also you can see a python file coding the solver using the Gurobi library with an Academic License provided to the University, in order to run the code you'll need to have Gurobi installed and an appropriate license to use it.

We also attached to this repo a .txt file containing the results achieved with the solver that includes the values of the respective variables and the resulting optimal value.
